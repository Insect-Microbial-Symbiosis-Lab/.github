The Insect-Microbial symbiosis Lab seeks to identify functional and trophic relationships that forge host-microbe interactions and shape bacterial communities, as well as traits that can predict the evolutionary outcomes of these symbioses. We also develop methods for generating insect model systems for linking microbes to host outcomes.
